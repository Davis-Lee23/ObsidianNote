# 2. Tips

<font color="#ff0000">**No work, no progress**</font>
You can't make any progress if you only learn but not work.

<font color="#ff0000">**Thinking is the only way**</font>
I don't think anyone can translate the native language into English, we need to think in English.

<font color="#ff0000">**Time != success**</font>
Wrong method, no progress

<font color="#ff0000">**Play, Jump, Swim**</font>
Have fun. Don't be shy. Immersion

<font color="#ff0000">**30 minutes**</font>
I think you need at least 30 minutes if you want to learn something, you need to make it a habit.

<font color="#ff0000">**Feedback**</font>
Find a forum or group. You should know what you doing.

<font color="#ff0000">**Lifestyle enjoy it**</font>

# 3、Reading
Reading is like a tree. Reading gives you a deeper understanding of the language.
This part will teach you how to read, what's the best way to read.

①知道一个词的使用语境. We can get feeling for what's weird and what isn't weird. Then you know what word should be used here.

②结合语境猜词，最重要的就是context

③Please use English dictionary

In a word, feeling enough situations, you'll use words in right place.
So first look at context, try to figure out in right place make things start going on here（脑） in English and go look it up
